# Face-Generation-using-GAN


Project Instructions: Face Generation
Getting the project files
The project files are located in the Project Workspace and include the following files:

dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb
README.md
requirements.txt
tests.py
processed-celeba-small.zip
We highly recommend using the Project Workspace to complete your project; however, if you choose to not use the workspace, you can download the project files from the Project Workspace.

Instructions
Open the notebook file, dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb and follow the instructions. This project is organized as follows:

Data Pipeline: implement a data augmentation function and a custom dataset class to load the images and transform them.
Model Implementation: build a custom generator and a custom discriminator to make your GAN
Loss Functions and Gradient Penalty: decide on loss functions and whether you want to use gradient penalty or not.
Training Loop: implement the training loop and decide on which strategy to use
Each section requires you to make design decisions based on the experience you have gathered in this course. Do not hesitate to come back to a section to improve your model or your data pipeline based on the results that you are getting.
